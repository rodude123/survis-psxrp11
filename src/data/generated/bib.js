In this paper, we described the game design for the game Checkers, which is developed by using an AI heuristic approach using HTML and JavaScript. A group of people chosen in this study to test the game, which is a validation process to confirm that the game goes as per requirement. The testing activity ends after the final bug fix and the result shows that the game executes properly as expected. The result indicates that the game meets the objective of the system, which is the game, may learn and explore by itself as a heuristic element.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes to use neural networks to solve a simplified version of Gomoku. More specifically, convolutional neural network and multi-dimensional recurrent network are trained separately using high-level human games. While the convolutional neural network was able to learn specific features for Gomoku without prior knowledge, the human game data set proved to be insufficient for a robust performance. The multi-dimensional recurrent network also suffered from the small database even though it was able to occasionally occasionally expert level moves.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an application that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to play checkers. The program application has a MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) and is equipped with a minimax algorithm. The AI has proven to be successful against the average student at the Universidad de Ingenier\u00eda y Tecnolog\u00eda (UTEC) in a game of checkers. The importance of this project resides in providing the first steps at research and implementation of artificial intelligence that could be used in applications such as robotics in manufacturing and project planning. The project accomplished the objectives of creating an AI GUI that could play checkers against UTEC students. As was expected, success of the AI depended on the depth of the minimax tree. The AI struggled against UTEC students while using tree depths of three and four levels; however, the AI proved successful against UTEC students at tree depths of five and six. The optimal level chosen for the checkers AI eventually was five levels of depth because for six or more levels, the time of minimax evaluation delayed too much for fluid human game play.",

        "abstract": "Technological developments in the field of moving goods are increasing rapidly. Production processes in fields such as the automotive, medical world, and even for household needs use the Pick and Place system for the production process. It has been proven, for a long time that research has improved the Pick and Place system for many sectors, especially how this process can be combined with AI. Because of this, there has been a lot of research on how to make robots to play games with their own brains. For now, most of the game development for AI is board games such as chess, Checkers, Tic Tac Toe, and other board games. Therefore, this project is expected to create a robot that can play board games. By implementing the gantry robot system, the robot will be made to play the Checkers game by integrating the robot with the existing AI checker. The concept of this robot is to use Checkers AI and machine integration with a camera where in this project the robot will compete with humans, the camera will detect it from the game board and then with the learning process from AI, the robot can determine where to move the pieces and it is hoped that the motor will move according to the AI output command of the Checkers Robot. After that the robot will return to its original position and wait for its turn.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, much research attention has been paid to evolving self-learning game players. Fogel's Blondie24 is just one demonstration of a real success in this field and it has inspired many other scientists. In this paper, evolutionary neural networks, evolved via an evolution strategy, are employed to evolve game-playing strategies for the game of Checkers. In addition, we introduce an individual and social learning mechanism into the learning phase of this evolutionary Checkers system. The best player obtained is tested against an implementation of an evolutionary Checkers program, and also against a player, which has been evolved within a round robin tournament. The results are promising and demonstrate that using individual and social learning enhances the learning process of the evolutionary Checkers system and produces a superior player compared to what was previously possible.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a new approach that combines Automatic Case Elicitation with Reinforcement Learning applied to Checkers player agents. This type of combination brings forth the following modifications in relation to those agents that use each of these techniques in isolation: improve the random exploration performed by the Automatic Case Elicitation-based agents and introduce adaptability to the Reinforcement Learning-based agents. In line with the above, the authors present herein the ACE-RL-Checkers player agent, a hybrid system that combines the best abilities from the automatic Checkers players CHEBR and LS-VisionDraughts. CHEBR is an Automatic Case Elicitation-based agent with a learning approach that performs random exploration in the search space. These random explorations allow the agent to present an extremely adaptive and non-deterministic behavior. On the other hand, the high frequency at which decisions are made randomly (mainly in those phases in which the content of the case library is still so scarce) compromises the agent in terms of maintaining a good performance. LS-VisionDraughts is a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network player trained through Reinforcement Learning. Besides having been proven efficient in making decisions, such an agent presents an inconvenience in that it is completely predictable, as the same move is always executed when presented with the same board of play. By combining the best abilities from these players, ACE-RL-Checkers uses knowledge provided from LS-VisionDraughts in order to direct random exploration of the automatic case elicitation technique to more promising regions in the search space. Therewith, the ACE-RL-Checkers gains in terms of performance as well as acquires adaptability in its decision-making - choosing moves based on the current game dynamics. Experiments carried out in tournaments involving these agents confirm the performance superiority of ACE-RL-Checkers when pitted against its adversaries.",

        "abstract": "The game of chess is the most widely-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.",

        "abstract": "The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approa<F2>ch to computer Go that uses \u2018value networks\u2019 to evaluate board positions and \u2018policy networks\u2019 to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.",

        "abstract": "Mastering the game of Go has remained a long-standing challenge to the field of AI. Modern computer Go programs rely on processing millions of possible future positions to play well, but intuitively a stronger and more \u2019humanlike\u2019 way to play the game would be to rely on pattern recognition rather than brute force computation. Following this sentiment, we train deep convolutional neural networks to play Go by training them to predict the moves made by expert Go players. To solve this problem we introduce a number of novel techniques, including a method of tying weights in the network to \u2019hard code\u2019 symmetries that are expected to exist in the target function, and demonstrate in an ablation study they considerably improve performance. Our final networks are able to achieve move prediction accuracies of 41.1\\% and 44.4\\% on two different Go datasets, surpassing previous state of the art on this task by significant margins. Additionally, while previous move prediction systems have not yielded strong Go playing programs, we show that the networks trained in this work acquired high levels of skill. Our convolutional neural networks can consistently defeat the well known Go program GNU Go and win some games against state of the art Go playing program Fuego while using a fraction of the play time.",
